	  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>One 9 inch X 13 inch cake pan.</li>
		<li>1 tbsp. of soft butter.</li>
		<li>Small amount of all purpose flour.</li>
		<li>3 large eggs at room temperature.</li>
		<li>One 15.25 oz. package of Duncan Hines Perfectly Moist Devil's Food Cake Mix.</li>
		<li>One 21 oz. can of Lucky Leaf Cherry fruit filling & topping.</li>
		<li>One 12 oz. package of Betty Crocker Whipped Chocolate Frosting.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Directions</h2>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Prepare pan by using your clean fingers to smear the soft butter around the
	bottom and sides of the pan. Sprinkle with all purpose flour and shake off 
	any excess.</li>
		<li>Beat the room temperature eggs until light and fluffy.</li>
		<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
		<li>Combine cake mix and beaten eggs and mix well. Add the cherry filling and mix
	until blended. (Don't use an electric mixer on this step).</li>
		<li>Fill the cake pan.</li>
		<li>When oven reached 350 degrees, place the cake pan on the center rack and bake for
	35-40 minutes. After about 30 minutes, begin testing the cake with a toothpick
	near the center. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.</li>
		<li>Wait until cake has completely cooled.</li>
		<li>Empty the package of frosting into a bowl, add 3 tsp. of water, and whip air into
	it using an electric mixer. This increases the volume and makes it easier to spread.</li>
	    <li>Frost the cake.</li>
		<li>Enjoy.</li>
