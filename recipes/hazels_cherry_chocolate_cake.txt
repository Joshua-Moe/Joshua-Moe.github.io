This is a recipe for "Hazel's Cherry Chocolate Cake"

Ingredients:

One 9 inch X 13 inch cake pan.
1 tbsp. of soft butter.
Small amount of all purpose flour.
3 large eggs at room temperature.
One 15.25 oz. package of Duncan Hines Perfectly Moist Devil's Food Cake Mix.
One 21 oz. can of Lucky Leaf Cherry fruit filling & topping.
One 12 oz. package of Betty Crocker Whipped Chocolate Frosting.

Directions:

1. Prepare pan by using your clean fingers to smear the soft butter around the
	bottom and sides of the pan. Sprinkle with all purpose flour and shake off 
	any excess.
2. Beat the room temperature eggs until light and fluffy.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
4. Combine cake mix and beaten eggs and mix well. Add the cherry filling and mix
	until blended. (Don't use an electric mixer on this step).
5. Fill the cake pan.
6. When oven reached 350 degrees, place the cake pan on the center rack and bake for
	35-40 minutes. After about 30 minutes, begin testing the cake with a toothpick
	near the center. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.
7. Wait until cake has completely cooled.
8. Empty the package of frosting into a bowl, add 3 tsp. of water, and whip air into
	it using an electric mixer. This increases the volume and makes it easier to spread.
9. Frost the cake.
10. Enjoy.
