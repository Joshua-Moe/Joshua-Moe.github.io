	  <img src="../images/state_fair_lemonade.jpg">
	  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>7 Lemons heavy, firm (but not hard) with bright yellow color and fairly thin
skins</li>
		<li>1 Â¼ cups of granulated white sugar</li>
		<li>5 cups of cold water</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Directions</h2>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Wash the lemons, and remove all price stickers. If the lemons feel waxy, scrub
them under hot water.</li>
		<li>Peel the zest off of 6 lemons using a vegetable peeler. Set these 6 peeled
lemons aside with the 1 unpeeled lemon.</li>
		<li>Put the lemon zest into a bowl, and cover with the granulated white sugar. Toss
to combine. Cover the bowl with clear plastic wrap, and let sit out for a minimum
of 2 hours to overnight. (The longer the better.)</li>
		<li>Put the water into a 3 qt. saucepan, and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, and
pour the zest and sugar mixture into the saucepan. Stir, and let sit until the
sugar is completely dissolved. (About 5 minutes)</li>
		<li>Pour all of this through a mesh strainer back into the bowl, and discard the zest.
Let cool to room temperature. (About 20 to 30 minutes)</li>
		<li>Roll the peeled lemons to break up the membranes inside. Cut these in half, and
squeeze the lemon juice into the bowl. Pour lemonade into a serving pitcher.
Cut that 7 th . Lemon into thin slices, and add to the pitcher. Wrap in clear plastic
wrap and chill thoroughly before serving over ice. (At least 2 hours)</li>
		<li>(Sweeten to taste next time by using more or less sugar.)</li>
