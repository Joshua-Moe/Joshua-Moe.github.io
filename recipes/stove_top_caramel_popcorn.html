	  <img src="../images/stove_top_caramel_popcorn.jpg">
	  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>One 5 QT. Stainless Steel Dutch Oven with a glass lid</li>
		<li>3 Tbsp. of Peanut Oil</li>
		<li>3 Tbsp. of butter</li>
		<li>12 Werther’s Original Caramel Hard Candies</li>
		<li>½ cup of Orville Redenbacher’s Original Popcorn kernels</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Directions</h2>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Put the Dutch Oven (DO) on the stove and set burner for medium high heat.
          After about 2 ½ minutes begin testing the temperature by dropping a small
          amount of water into the DO. When a drop of water forms a little ball that rolls
          around, the temperature is correct.</li>
		<li>Add the oil, and swirl it around to completely coat the bottom of the DO. This is
          how you make your stainless steel cookware non-stick.</li>
		<li>Add the butter and candies. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon until the
          candies have completely melted.</li>
		<li>Add the kernels. Stir to completely coat them and spread in one layer on the
          bottom of the DO. Put the lid on.</li>
		<li>Gently shake the DO every few seconds to prevent kernels from burning.</li>
		<li>When popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the DO from the heat.</li>
		<li>Let the DO sit for a couple minutes before removing the lid.</li>
		<li>Pour the popcorn into serving bowls, and ENJOY.</li>
