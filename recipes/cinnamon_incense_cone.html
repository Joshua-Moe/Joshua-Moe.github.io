	  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Cinnamon</li>
		<li>Water</li>
		<li>A coffee scoop to use as a mold</li>
		<li>A packer like a finger or a short piece of wood dowel</li>
		<li>A clean working surface</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Directions</h2>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Fill your mold with cinnamon and empty it onto your work surface.</li>
		<li>Add approximately 2 tsp. of water. Mix with your fingers until you have made a paste.</li>
		<li>Pack this paste into your mold a little at a time until itâ€™s full.</li>
		<li>Place the mold in a sunny location and let the cone dry out and harden for approximately 24 hours.</li>
		<li>Gently remove the cone from the mold, and put the cone back in the sunny location for another 24 hours or more. The drier the cone, the better.</li>
		<li>Light up, and enjoy. It might be a little difficult to light, but once lit it will burn down to a pile of ash.</li>
